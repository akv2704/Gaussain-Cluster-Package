# Gaussain-Cluster-Package
Create and implement Gaussian operations on clusters. The file includes a number of functions that help work with covariance matrices and help implement Gaussian
operations on Gaussian states. There are functions available to create 1D and 2D cluster covariances and Homodyne measurements based on specific measurement angle patterns.
